I made an online backgammon game for Android. This is my first Android app, so it might suck (hopefully not too much).

It's kinda like WordFeud or Wordwise (or Words with Friends), but backgammon instead of scrabble. 

Since you guys are awesome, you can [download it here](http://dl.drakeapps.com/BackgammonReddit.apk) for free. 

It's also on the market for $0.99. Search for Backgammon Online to find it. 

I tested it on the emulator and my friend's EVO, and it seemed to work really well. I don't have one of these fancy phones myself, or else it would've had more testing.

Let me know what you think and if you find any problems with it (which I'm sure there will be)

Note: It doesn't do notifications. You have to open the app and go to the online part. I'll try to put notifications in it soon.
